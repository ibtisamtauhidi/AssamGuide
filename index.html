		<h1>Tea in Assam</h1>
		<a href="#menupanel" data-icon="bars">Menu</a>
	</div><!-- /header -->
	<div data-role="content">	
		<p>Of the agriculture-based industries, tea occupies an important place in Assam. The plants used to grow naturally in the Upper Brahmaputra valley. Robert Bruce, an official of the British empire, who is credited with the discovery of tea in Assam in 1823, gave publicity of the existence of the plant, the leaves of which were boiled to prepare the tea.</p>
		<p>In Assam, tea is grown both in the Brahmaputra and Barak plains. Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sibsagar, Jorhat, Golaghat, Nagaon and Sonitpur are the districts where tea gardens are mostly found. Assam produces 51% of the tea produced in India and about 1/6th of the tea produced in the world.</p>
		<p>In 1911 a Tea Research Centre was started at Toklai in Jorhat for developing more scientific and fruitful methods of cultivating tea plants, applying fertilizer, testing soil, selecting sites for garden and processing tea leaves. This is the oldest and largest Tea Research Centre in the world.</p>
		<p>Instant tea project was established at the Tea Research Centre of Toklai Experimental Station in 1974. Instant tea is a golden coloured powder which dissolves in hot or cold water easily.</p>
		<p>For a better marketing of the tea produced in Assam and the entire North EasternStates, a Tea Auction Centre - Guwahati Tea Auction Centre - was established in 1970 at Guwahati. This is the world's largest CTC tea auction centre and the world's second largest in terms of total tea. It now auctions more than 150 million kg of tea valued at more than Rs 550.00 crores annually.</p>
		<p>Tea industry has contributed substantially to the economy of Assam. About 17 percent of the workers of Assam are engaged in the tea industry. </p>

		<p>The history of Assam is the history of a confluence of people from the east, west and the north; the confluence of the Indo-Aryan, Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman cultures. Politically, it has been invaded, but has never served as a vassal or a colony to an external power till the advent of the Burmese in 1821 and subsequently the British in 1826.</p>
		<p>The history of Assam is known from many sources. The Ahom kingdom of medieval Assam maintained chronicles, called Buranjis, written in the Ahom and the Assamese languages. History of ancient Assam comes from rock inscriptions and the many copper plates and royal grants the Kamarupa kings issued during their reign. Protohistory is reconstructed from folklore, epics like Mahabharata, and two medieval texts compiled in the Assam region—the Kalika Purana and the Yogini Tantra.</p>

				<h3>Pre-history</h3>
				<p>Assam state and adjoining regions have evidences of human settlements from all the periods of the Stone ages, but there are no archeological evidence of bronze- or iron-age culture. The hills at the height of 1,500–2,000 feet (460 to 615 m) were popular habitats probably due to availability of exposed doleritic basalt useful for tool-making. According to a late text, Kalika Purana (c.7th–8th AD), the earliest ruler of Assam was Mahiranga Danav of the Danava dynasty, which was removed by Naraka who established his the Naraka dynasty. The last of these rulers, also Naraka, was slain by Krishna. Naraka's son Bhagadatta became the king, who, it is mentioned in the Mahabharata, fought for the Kauravas in the battle of Kurukshetra with an army of kiratas, chinas and dwellers of the eastern coast.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Ancient</h3>
				<p>The historical account begins with Samudragupta's 4th century Allahabad inscription that mentions Kamarupa and Davaka as frontier kingdoms of the Gupta Empire. Davaka was soon absorbed by Kamarupa kingdom which grew into large kingdom that spanned from Karatoya river to Sadiya and covered the entire Brahmaputra valley and, at times, North Bengal and Northern Bangladesh. Ruled by three dynasties Varmanas (c.350–650 CE), Mlechchha dynasty (c.655–900 CE) and Kamarupa-Palas (c.900–1100 CE) from their capitals in present-day Guwahati (Pragjyotishpura), Tezpur (Haruppeswara) and Durjaya respectively, it was 10,000 li in circuit and capital city Pragjyotishpura was about 30 li. Kamrupi kings claims their descent from Narakasura, an immigrant from Aryavarta. In the reign of the Varman king, Bhaskar Varman(c. 600–650 AD), the Chinese traveler Xuan Zang visited the region and recorded his travels. Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was somewhat extended till c. 1255 AD by the Lunar I (c. 1120–1185 AD) and Lunar II (c. 1155–1255 AD) dynasties.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Medieval</h3>
				<p>Two later dynasties, the Ahoms and the Koch. The Ahoms, a Tai group, ruled Upper Assam for nearly 600 years (1228–1826 AD) and the Koch, a Tibeto-Burmese, established sovereignty in c. 1510 AD. The Koch kingdom in western Assam and present North Bengal was at its zenith in the early reign of Naranarayana (c. 1540–1587 AD). It split into two in c. 1581 AD, the western part as a Moghul vassal and the eastern as an Ahom satellite state. Since c. 13th AD, the nerve centre of Ahom polity was upper Assam; the kingdom was gradually extended till Karatoya River in the c. 17th–18th AD. It was at its zenith during the reign of Sukhrungpha or Sworgodeu Rudra Simha (c. 1696–1714 AD). Among other dynasties, the Sutiya Kingdom ruled north-eastern Assam and parts of present Arunachal Pradesh and the Kacharis ruled from Dikhow River to central and southern Assam. With expansion of Ahom kingdom, by c. 1520 AD the Sutiyas areas were annexed and since c. 1536 AD Kacharis remained only in Cachar and North Cachar more as an Ahom ally then a competing force. Despite numerous invasions, mostly by the Muslim rulers, no western power ruled Assam until the arrival of the British. Though the Mughals made seventeen attempts to invade they were not successful. The most successful invader Mir Jumla, a governor of Aurangzeb, briefly occupied Garhgaon (c. 1662–63 AD), the then capital, but found it difficult to control people making guerrilla attacks on his forces, forcing them to leave. The decisive victory of the Assamese led by the great general Lachit Borphukan on the Mughals, then under command of Raja Ram Singha at Saraighat (1671) had almost ended Mughal ambitions in this region. Mughals were finally expelled from Lower Assam during the reign of Gadadhar Singha in 1682 AD.</p>

				<h3>Colonial era</h3>
				<p>In the later part of 18th century, religious tensions and atrocities of nobles led to the Moamoria rebellion, resulting in tremendous casualties of lives and property. The rebellion was suppressed but the kingdom was severely weakened by the civil war. Political rivalry between Prime Minister Purnananda Burhagohain and Badan Chandra Borphukan, the Ahom Viceroy of Western Assam, led to the invitation of Burmese by the latter, in turn leading to three successive Burmese invasions of Assam. The reigning monarch Chandrakanta Singha tried to check the Burmese invaders but he was defeated after fierce resistance. A reign of terror was unleashed by the Burmese on the Assamese people, who fled to neighbouring kingdoms and British-ruled Bengal. The Burmese reached the East India Company's borders, and the First Anglo-Burmese War ensued in 1824. The war ended under the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826, with the Company taking control of Western Assam and installing Purandar Singha as king of Upper Assam in 1833. The arrangement lasted till 1838 and thereafter the British gradually annexed the entire region. Initially Assam was made a part of the Bengal Presidency, then in 1906 it was a part of Eastern Bengal and Assam province, and in 1912 it was reconstituted into a chief commissioners' province. In 1913, a legislative council and, in 1937, the Assam Legislative Assembly, were formed in Shillong, the erstwhile capital of the region. The British tea planters imported labour from central India adding to the demographic canvas. After a few initial unsuccessful attempts to free Assam during the 1850s, the Assamese joined and actively supported the Indian National Congress against the British from the early 20th century.</p>
				<p>At the turn of the 20th century, British India consisted of eight provinces that were administered either by a governor or a lieutenant-governor. The Assam Province was one amongst those major eight provinces of British India.</p>
				<p>During the partition of Bengal (1905–1911), the new province of Assam and East Bengal was created as a lieutenant-governorship. In 1911, East Bengal was reunited with Bengal, and the new provinces in the east became: Assam, Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.</p>
				<div style='text-align: center;'><img src='./img/400px-Kanaklata_Udyan,_Tezpur.jpg' width='width: 150px;' /></div>
				<p>In 1947, Assam including the present Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya became a state of the Union of India (princely states, Manipur and Tripura became Group C provinces) and a district of Assam, Sylhet, chose to join Pakistan.</p>

				<h3>Modern history</h3>
				<p>Since 1947, with increasing economic problems in the region, separatist groups began forming along ethnic lines, and demands for autonomy and sovereignty grew, resulting into fragmentation of Assam.</p>
				<p>Since the mid-20th century, people from present Bangladesh have been migrating to Assam. In 1961, the Government of Assam passed a legislation making use of Assamese language compulsory. It had to be withdrawn later under pressure from Bengali speaking people in Cachar. In the 1980s the Brahmaputra valley saw a six-year Assam Agitation triggered by the discovery of a sudden rise in registered voters on electoral rolls. It tried to force the government to identify and deport foreigners illegally migrating from neighboring Bangladesh and changing the demographics. The agitation ended after an accord between its leaders and the Union Government, which remained unimplemented, causing simmering discontent.</p>
				<p>The post 1970s experienced the growth of armed separatist groups like United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) and National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB). In November 1990, the Government of India deployed the Indian army, after which low-intensity military conflicts and political homicides have been continuing for more than a decade. In recent times, ethnicity based militant groups have also mushroomed. Regional autonomy has been ensured for Bodo-Kachari community in Bodoland Territorial Council Areas (BTC), for the Karbis in Karbi Anglong and for the people of Dima Hasao district after agitation of the communities due to sluggish rate of development and general apathy of successive state governments towards indigenous communities.</p>

				<h3>Bihu</h3>
				<p>Bihu is the most important festival of Assam. It is celebrated with joy and abundance by all Assamese people irrespective of caste, creed, religion, faith and belief. Bihu can be broadly divided into three categories: Bohag Bihu which augurs the wish for a good harvest because this is the time when farmers start sowing, Kaati Bihu which is observed to mark the cutting and binding of grains and Magh Bihu which marks the season of harvesting of grains.</p>
				<p>Tribal groups like the Mishings, the Deoris, and the Morans celebrate "Bihu" with dances of their own distinctive style.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Ambubachi Mela</h3>
				<p>Is the most important festival of Kamakhya temple of Guwahati and is held every year during monsoon (mid-June). It is a ritual of austerities celebrated with 'Tantric rites'. It is a common belief that the reigning diety, 'Kamakhya' , 'The Mother Shakti' goes through her annual cycle of menstruation during this period.</p>
				<p>During Ambubashi the doors of the temple remain closed for three days. It is believed that the earth becomes impure for three days. During this time no farming work is undertaken. Daily worship and other religious performances are suspended during this period. After three days, the temple doors are reopened after the Goddess is bathed and other rituals performed. It is believed that the mother earth regains her purity now. This is purely a ritual of Tantric cult.</p>
				<p>Ambubachi mela is held at the Kamakhya temple, after being closed for the afore-mentioned three days. On the fourth day only the devotees are allowed to enter inside the temple for worship. Thousands of devotees from all over India visit this mela.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Me-Dum-Me-Phi</h3>
				<p>The most important Ahom festival which deserves mention is the Me-Dum-Me-Phi, i.e., the ancestor worship festival which is observed by the whole Ahom community. This is performed annually on the 31st of January at some common venue. This in a way helps to develop social contacts and community feelings among the Ahoms. Colourful processions with devotees in traditional finery are also taken out on the occasion.</p>
				<div style='text-align: center;'><img src='./img/744px-Bengal_gazetteer_1907-9.jpg' width="30%"/></div>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Jonbill Mela</h3>
				<p>This spectacular fair(mela) is held every year during winter at Jonbeel of Jagiroad, a lesser known township only 32 kms from Guwahati. A few days before the mela, tribes like the Tiwas, Karbis, Khasis, Jaintias from the Meghalaya hills come down with their various products for this mela. On the occasion of the 'mela' a big bazar is held here where these tribes exchange thier products with local people in barter system which is very rare in a civilized modern society.</p>
				<p>Before the 'mela' they perform fire worship or agni puja for the well being of mankind. It is to be noted that during this mela the 'govaraja' or the king of the Tiwa trbe along with his courtiers visit this mela and collect taxes from his subjects. The significant point of this mela is its theme of harmony and brotherhood amongst various tribes and communities. During the 'mela' these communities perform their traditional dances and music to celebrate the mela in a befitting manner.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Baishagu</h3>
				<p>Famous for its myriad colours and merriment, 'Baishagu' is generally celebrated by the Bodo Kacharis during mid April. It is the most cherished festival of the Bodo tribe. The Bodos also celebrate it as a springtime festival at the advent of the new year.</p>
				<p>The first day begins with worship of the cow. The next day which synchronises with the first day of the month of 'Bohag' of the Assamese almanac, the actual merriment begins with the young people of each household reverentialy bowing down to their parents and elders. The supreme deity 'Bathou' or Lord Shiva is worshipped during the festival by offering chicken and rice beer. In the Baishagu dance there is no age or sex bar, all are welcome to join in. The traditional musical instruments that are used in this dance festival are 'Khum' (drum), 'Jotha' (Manjari), 'Khawbang' (Taal), 'Gogona' (Mouth-organ) and 'Siphung' (Flute) etc. It is also customary at the time of closure of the Baishagu festival to offer community prayers at a particular place called 'Garjasali'.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Bohaggiyo Bishnu</h3>
				<p>This is the most fascinating spring festival of the Deoris of Assam, one of the four divisions of the Chutiyas, who are believed to have been members of the great Boro race. The term 'Bishu' might have originated from the Chutiya word 'Bishu'. 'Bi' means extreme and 'Su' means 'rejoicing' like other Springtime tribal festivals.</p>
				<p>Bohaggiyo Bishu is also observed during mid-April at a stretch for seven days withunrestricted joy and merrymaking. It is to be observed that the Deoris Bishu do not always fall on the Sankranti Day. The Bishu must be preceded by a 'Than puja' and evidently it must start on a Wednesday. There is much socio-religious significance and arrangements to be made before the puja. Once in every four years a white buffalo is sacrificed which is considered a substitute for the traditional human sacrifice. The Deodhani dance is the most important and significant part of the festival. Husori or carol song party is the main attraction.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Gabra</h3>
				<p>The annual festival of the colourful Dimasa tribe. It is exclusively a socio-religious festival which is generally observed before starting a new cultivation. Rajini Gabra is celebrated during day time. The 'Kunang' or the village headman propitiates the family deity by closing the village gate on the worship date. On the same night in a function called 'Harni Gabra', the presiding deity is worshipped for the protection and welfare of the people.</p>
				<p>It is very interesting to note that during the Rajini Gabra and Hami Gabra festival if any outsider enters the village inspite off seeing the closed gate, the entire function is considered to be spoilt. The intruders then have to bear the total cost for holding the festival anew.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Rongkar and Chomangkan</h3>
				<p>Rongker and Chomangkan are the two most important festivals of the Karbis, an indeginous tribe of Karbi Anglong.</p>
				<p>Rongker is basically a springtime festival of merriment and is performed at the beginning of the New year, i.e. April. To propitiate different gods and goddesses for the well being of the entire village, the elderly male folk organise Rongker so thatpeople can be free from diseases and natural calamities for the entire year. They pray for a good harvest too. The women are not allowed to enter the worship arena during this festival.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, Chomangkan is the festival dedicated to the dead. It is primarily a death ceremony. There is no particular time for holding this funeral ceremony. It depends upon the convenience of the locality. This festival is a must for every Karbi. It is a nonstop four days and four nights celebration.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Ali-Ai-Ligang</h3>
				<p>Ali-Ai-Ligang, the spring festival of the Mishing Tribe is the most colourful festival held every year on the first Wednesday (Ligange lange) of the month of 'Ginmur Polo' (February-March). 'Ali' means root, seed; 'Ai' means fruit and 'Ligang' means sow. That is why 'ceremonial' sowing of paddy starts on this day. A dance is performed by the young boys and girls, characterized by brisk stepping, flinging and flapping of hands and swaying of hips reflecting youthful passion, reproductive urge and joie-de-vivre.</p>
				<p>"Poro Aapong" or rice beer, Pork and dried fish is essential for the feast. The festival continues for five days and during this festival certain taboos with respect to the cutting of trees, fishing, ploughing, burning jungles etc. are strictly observed.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Baikho</h3>
				<p>There is another colourful tribe in Assam, known as Rabhas. Although the Rabha community does not have any national festival of their own, the different groups celebrate their own festivals. The 'Baikho' or the Springtime festival is only celebrated to propitiate the goddess of wealth 'Baikho'. But unfortunately the pomp and grandeur of Baikho are not to be seen nowadays in the villages.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Dosa Tholi Long Nai</h3>
				<p>This is a very important religious dance performed at the 'Bathou Puja' or worshipping of God-Shiva. In this dance the priestess called Deodini dances with a bowl of blood of a sacrificed fowl on her head. It is believed that while the Deodini performs this dance in a trance, Lord Bathou (Shiva) will snatch away the bowl and drink the blood.</p>

	<div data-role="content">	
		<p>The people of Assam have traditionally been craftsmen from time immemorial.Though Assam is mostly known for its exquisite silks and the bamboo and caneproducts, several other crafts are also made here. Different regions of Assam are known for their different forms of art and handicrafts.</p>
		<div data-role="collapsible-set" data-theme="c" data-content-theme="d" data-inset='false'>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Cane and Bamboo</h3>
				<p>Cane and bamboo have remained inseparable parts of life in Assam. Grown in abundance here and hence most of the household articles in the homes of Assamese are made of cane and bamboo. They happen to be the two most commonly-used items in daily life, ranging from household implements to construction of dwelling houses to furniture to weaving accessories to musical instruments.</p>
				<p>The Jappi, the traditional sunshade continues to be the most prestigious of bamboo items of the state, and it has been in use since the days when the great Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang came to Assam that visitors are welcomed with a jaapi.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Metal Crafts</h3>
				<p>Bell-metal and brass have been the most commonly used metals for the Assamese artisan. Traditional utensils and fancy artiicles designed by these artisans are found in every Assamese household. The Xorai and bota have in use for centuries, to offer betel-nut and paan while welcoming distinguished guests.</p>
				<p>The entire population of two townships near Guwahati - Hajo and Sarthebari, are engaged in producing traditional bell-metal and brass articles. They have also used their innovative skills to design modern day articles to compete with the changing times.</p>
				<p>Gold, silver and copper too form a part of traditional metal craft in Assam and the State Museum in Guwahati has a rich collection of items made of these metals. Gold however is now used only for ornaments.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Handlooms</h3>
				<p>Assam's silk fabrics have earned immense recognition from all over the world. The state is the home of several types of silks, the most prominent and prestigious being muga, the golden silk exclusive to this state. Muga apart, there is paat, as also eri, the latter being used in manufacture of warm clothes for winter. Of a naturally rich golden colour, muga is the finest of India's wild silks. It is produced only in Assam.</p>
				<p>The women of Assam weave fairy tales in their looms. In earlier times, te skill to weave was the primary qualification of a young girl for her eligibility for marriage. This perhaps explains why Assam has the largest concentration of handlooms and weavers in India. One of the world's finest artistic traditions finds expression in their exquisitely woven 'Eri', 'Muga' and 'Pat' fabrics.</p>
				<p>The traditional handloom silks still hold their own in world markets They score over factory-made silks in the richness of their textures and designs, in their individuality, character and classic beauty. No two handwoven silks are exactly alike. Personality of the weaver, her hereditary skill, her innate sense of colour and balance all help to create a unique product.</p>
				<p>Today, India exports a wide variety of silks to western Europe and the United States, especially as exclusive furnishing fabrics. Boutiques and fashion houses, designers and interior decorators have the advantage of getting custom-woven fabrics in the designs, weaves and colours of their choice. A service that ensures an exclusive product not easily repeatable by competitors.</p>
				<p>The Tribals on the other hand have a wide variety of colourful costumes, some of which have earned International repute through the export market.</p>
				<p>Weaving in Assam is so replete with artistic sensibility and so intimately linked to folk life that Gandhiji, during his famous tour to promote khadi and swadeshi, was so moved that he remarked : "Assamese women weave fairy tales in their clothes!"</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Toys</h3>
				<p>The toys of Assam can be broadly classified under four heads (i) clay toys (ii) pith (iii) wooden and bamboo toys (iv) cloth and cloth-and-mud toys.</p>
				<p>While the human figure, especially dolls, brides and grooms, is the most common theme of all kinds of toys, a variety of animals forms have also dominated the clay-toys scene of Assam. Clay traditionally made by the Kumar and Hira communities, have often depicted different animals too, while gods, goddesses and other mythological figures also find importance in the work of traditional artist.</p>
				<p>Pith or Indian cork has also been used for toy-making since centuries in Assam. Such toys are chiefly made in the Goalpara region and they include figures of gods, animals and birds, the last of which again dominate the over-all output.</p>
				<p>Wood and bamboo on the other hand have been in use for making toys for several centuries, and like the other mediums, come as birds, animals and human figures.</p>
				<p>Toys of cloth as also with a mixture of cloth and mud too have constituted part of the rich Assamese toy-making tradition. While the art of making cloth toys have been traditionally handed down from mother to daughter in every household, the cloth-and-mud toys are generally used for puppet theatres. Among the household toys, the bride and the groom are the most common characters, while the other varieties have animals and mythological characters as the plays demand.</p>

				<h3>Pottery</h3>
				<p>Pottery is probably as old as human civilisation itself. In Assam, pottery can be traced back to many centuries.</p>
				<p>The Kumars and Hiras are two traditional potter communities of Assam and while the Kumars use the wheel to produce his pots, the Hiras are probably the only potters in the world who do not use the wheel at all. Again, among the Hiras, only the womenfolk are engaged in pottery work, while their men help them in procuring the raw materials and selling the wares.</p>
				<p>The most commonly-used pottery products include earthern pots and pitchers, plates, incense-stick holders, earthern lamps etc, while modern-day decoratives have also found place in their latest designs.</p>

				<h3>Woodcraft</h3>
				<p>Assam has always remained one of the most forest-covered states of the country, and the variety of wood and timber available here have formed a part of the people's culture and ecomony.</p>
				<p>An Assamese can identify the timber by touching it even in darkness, and can produce a series of items from it. While decorative panels in the royal Ahom palaces of the past and the 600-years old satras or Vaishnative monasteries are intricately carved on wood, a special class of people who excelled in wood carving came to be known as Khanikar, a surname proudly passed down from generation to generation.</p>
				<p>The various articles in a satra and naam-ghar(place of worship) are stiff cut on wood, depicting the guru asana (pedestal of the lords), apart from various kinds of birds and animals figuring in mythology.</p>
				<p>Modern-day Khanikar have taken to producing articles of commercial values, including figures of one-horned rhino and replicas of the world-famous Kamakhya temple - two items heading the list of demands of a visitor from outside.</p>

				<h3>Masks</h3>
				<p>With tribal art and folk elements form the base of Assamese culture, masks havefound an important place in the cultural activities of the people. Masks have been widely used in folk theatres and bhaonas with the materials ranging from terracotta to pith to metal, bamboo and wood.</p>
				<p>Similarly, among the tribals too, the use of masks is varied and widespread, especially in their colourful dances which again revolve chiefly around thier typical tribal myth and folklore. Such traditional masks have of late found thier way to the modern-day drawing rooms as decorative items and wall-hangings, thus providing self-employment opportunities to those who have been traditionally making them.</p>

				<h3>Jewellery</h3>
				<p>Gold has always constituted the most-used metal for jewellery in Assam, while the use of silver and other metals too have been there for centuries.</p>
				<p>In the old days, gold was locally available, flowing down several Himalayan rivers, of which Subansiri is the most important. In fact, a particular tribe of people, the Sonowal Kacharis were engaged only for gold-washing in these rivers.</p>
				<p>Jorhat in Upper Assam is one place where the traditional Assamese form of manufacture of jewellery is still in vogue, and people flock to Jorhat to get the exquisite Assamese jewellery. Assamese jewellery include the doog-doogi, loka-paro, bana, gaam-kharu, gal-pata, jon-biri, dhol-biri and keru, all of which have also encouraged the modern jewellers to producing similiar designs mechanically.</p>

			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Terracotta</h3>
				<p>Terracotta as a medium has dominated the handicraft scene of Assam since time immemorial. The tradition itself has been handed down from the generation to generation without break. Today we have the descendent of such families engaged in improvised terracotta versions of various common figures of gods and goddesses to mythological characters, while toys, vases, etc have also found a new life.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Traditional Paintings</h3>
				<p>The tradition of paintings in Assam can be traced back to several centuries in the past. Ahom palaces and satras and naam-ghar etc still abound in brightly-coloured paintings depicting various stories and events from history and mythology. In fact, the motifs and designs contained in Chitra-Bhagavata have come to become a traditional style for Assamese painters of the later period, and are still in practice today.</p>

		<p>One factor that construes as the binding agent of the various Assamese people is its Bihu festival. Three varieties of it, the Bhogali, Rogali and Kati Bihu, the festival is a dogged representation of Assamese identity and its uniqueness. The local flavour of celebration, however, goes way beyond just the Assamese folklore with the large number ethnic tribes like Mising, Karbi, Boro Dimasa, Rabha, Tiwa, Garo, Jayantia etc. having their own distinctive cultural features, facets and forms. The sheer physical beauty of these tribal people, their intricately woven attire ensembles and the striking colors of their clothes coupled with the incredible landscape that they call their homeland makes the composition of Assam's demography one of the most desirably diverse in the world.</p>

				<h3>Overview</h3>

It is also customary at the end of Baishagu festival to offer community prayer at a particular place called, `garjasali'.</p>
				<p><strong>Bohaggiyo Bishu:</strong> The most fascinating spring festival of the Deoris. The Deoris are one of the four divisions of the Chutiyas, which are believed to have been members of the great Bodo race. Like other springtime festivals, Bihagiyo Bishu is also observed durinf rnid-april at a stretch for seven days with unrestricted joy and merrymaking. The Bihsu must be preceded by a Than Puja and evidently it must start on Wednesday. There is also much socio religious significance and arrangements, to be made before the puja. The Deodhani dance forms the most important significant part of the festival.</p>
				<p><strong>Rajini Gabdra & Harini Gabra:</strong> The annual festival of the colourful Dimasa tribe. It is exclusively socio religious festival which is generally observed before the starting of new cultivation. Rajini Gabra is celebrated during the day time. The `Kunang' or village headman, propitiates family deity by closing the village gate on the puja day. In the same night the function called `Harini Gabra' the presiding deity is worshiped for protection and welfare of the people.</p>
				<p><strong>Rongker and Chomangkan:</strong> Rongker and Chomangkan are the two most important festivals of the Karbis. Rongker is basically a springtime festival and is performed at the beginning of the New year. To propitiate different Gods and Goddess for the well being of the entire village, the elderly malefolk organize Rongker so that people could be free from diseases, natural calamities for the entire year. They pray for good harvest too.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, Chomangkan is a festival, dedicated to the dead. It is primarily a death ceremony. There is no particular time for holding this funeral ceremony.

				<h3>Tribal Dances & Festivals</h3>
				<p>Each tribal groups has its own stock of folk dances which are attractive as much for the flowing movements as for the colouful costumes and the earthy quality of the accompanying music.</p>
				<p><strong>Bodo dances:</strong> Some of the important dances of the Bodos are associated with the Kherai Puja festivals are ritualistic in nature. The samanastic dances are pertbrmed by the deodhani (female shaman) in a state of trance, often with vigorous movements of the head, tossing and swinging the disheveled hair. Similar deodhani dances are in vogue among other tribal groups and also sections of the non-tribals.</p>
				<p>A most graceful and captivating dance of the Bodos is the famous Bagurumba dance maidens. In this dance full of rhythm and vivacity, the dancers hop and swing, bend and unbend, and at times give the impression of fluttering butterflies.</p>
				<p>Various dances are performed on the Rabha Baikhu and Pharkanti festivals. In some of these dances performed by mixed groups of boy s and girls, the dancers carry swords and shields, and in some other, peculiar wood and bamboo musical instruments with toy figures of birds that are made to flap their wings with the beating of the time.</p>
				<p><strong>Mishing dances:</strong> The best Mishing dances form integral parts of the two major Mishing festivals- Ali-Ai-Lvigang, and Po-rag. Hunting, fishing, arrow shooting, rowing, weaving, transplanting and harvesting etc. are artistically depicted in the Ali-Ai-Lvigang dances in which all people — men and women, young and old, married and single — dance in rows and circles. In Po-rag, there take place lively' friendly competition in dancing and drumming.</p>
				<p><strong>Dances of Tiwa:</strong> While the hill Tiwas have some impressive dances connected with the Sagra-misawa. Wan-sawa and Langkhun Puja ceremonies, the most interesting dances of the plains Tiwas are adjuncts of the Barat-puja ceremony, featuring the use of a peculiar musical instrument called sarai-lau and of masks representing various gods and animals.</p>
				<p><strong>Karbi dances:</strong> Of the many folk dances of the Karbis, perhaps the most important are those of a ritualistic nature centering round the Chomanhkan, the elaborate death ceremony. Banjar kekan is a hilarious all male dance in which specially decorated bamboo poles figure prominently. In Nimso-kerang dance, the contents of the accompanying songs are highly erotic. In the dance, while the young men hold shields and sticks in their hands, the girls, their heads covered with black scarves. Hachcha-kekan is another boisterous group dance performed on the occasion of the harvest festival. The plains karbis have a different set of songs and dances, one of the most spectacular involving the stepping in and out of spaces between bamboo poles held and moved rhythmically on the ground.</p>
				<p><strong>Dimasa dances:</strong> The Dimasas of Dima Hsao (formerly N.C.Hills) district have ritualistic dances performed in ceremonies like Rajini Gabra and Harni Gabra in which the oracle takes part in a state of possession. The group dance of boys and girls in the harvest festival Busu has most interesting rhythmic and choreographic patterns fitted to the haunting music of the peculiar Dimasa pipe called muri.</p>

				<h3>Performance Arts</h3>
				<p><strong>Music, dance, drama:</strong> Assam has been a land of music and dance is borne out by evidences, both direct and indirect, obtainable from epigraphic, sculptural. historical and literary sources. While references to musicians and dancers are frequently met with in old inscriptions and other records, old sculptures abound in panels depicting singing and dancing scenes.</p>
				<p><strong>Music:</strong> Raga music must have made its entry into this area very early on. The Charyapadas composed in the Northeastern region between 8th and I lth centuries were meant for rendering in specific ragas like Pata-Manjari, Gavada, Guijari. and so on. This tradition seems to have been carried down through the centuries as can be surmised from the fact that Assamese Panchali poets of the 16th century used for their lyrical compositions a set of ragas, some of which had identical names with Charyapada ragas. The Vaishnavite saints were connoisseurs of classical music.</p>
				<p><strong>Oja-pali</strong> is a very old performing art form of Assam, which combines narrative singing ‘vith dancing and dramatic interludes. The music of Oja-pali has a raga system of clearly classical orientation, and the concerned dance recalls classical movements, postures and hand-gestures. The classical elements are more pronounced in the Vaishnavite variety of Oja-pali than in the Sakta variety.</p>
				<p><strong>Neo</strong> Vaishnavite some of the best treasures of Assamese performing arts are associated with the neo-Vaishnavite heritage and best preserved in the Satras First, there are the Vaishnavite musical forms of which the most remarkable is a classical genre with distinctive system of ragas and talits introduced bv the great vinous sankardeva. This genre is represented by bargits- literally meaning great songs, which are highly refined devotional compositions -- and natar gits or songs incorporated in dramas. Also worthy of mention is the satriya dance, so cal led because its association with the satras, which has all the ingredients of an Indian classical dance and which has gained all India notice as such.</p>
				<p>Then there is the <strong>bahona</strong>, the Vaishnava dramatic performance, which owes its genesis to the dramas written and produced by sankardeva with great originality, and which is the Assamese cognate of the Yaksha-gana of Karnataka, the Kathakali of Kerala, the Bhagavatamela of Andrha Pradesh and the Ramleela and Rashleela of uttar Pradesh.</p>
				<p><strong>Bhaona:</strong> The ideal type of Bhaona is the Ankiya Bhaona involving the performance of a play composed by Sankardeva or Madhavadeva, clearly reminiscent of the orthodox Sanskrit drama tradition. But ordinary performances have more of down-to-earth characteristics and often verge on the folk. While the Oja-pali art form also contains dramatic elements, much of these are folk nature. The Dhulias of the Kamrup region are parties of drummers who, apart from providing music on auspicious and festive occasions, perform spectacular acrobatic feats over and above, present dramatic skits saturated with wit, humour and sarcasm of a rough and ready nature. Kushan-gan and Bhari-gan are two popular folk drama forms of the Goalpara reaion, of which the former relies more on music and dance while the later is distinguished by the use of heavy.</p>
				<p><strong>Masks:</strong> As for folk songs and folk dances for which Assam is famous, a sizeable proportion of the rich and varied fare happens to be intimately linked up with rituals, ceremonies and festivals of the various communities both tribal and non-tribal.</p>

				<h3>Art</h3>
				<p>Assam has been a centre for art since ancient times. The earliest record of a thriving artistic tradition can be found in the 7th century Harshacharitra which documents how the king of Kamrup Kumar Bhaskar Verman, sent large samples of paintings, easles and canvases to the Gupta king, Harshavardhana, as a token of friendship.</p>
				<p>Royal patronage determined the themes in much of the art produced in the state, such as the bulky Hastividyarnava, a pictorial treatise on the management and care of elephants in the royal stables.</p>
				<p>The neo-Vaishnavite religion propagated by Sankardeva during the 15th century would start an artistic revolution that is clearly visible in works such as Chitra Bhagavata (1539 AD), a narrative of the life of Lord Krishna through paintings. The paintings in the 17th century Assamese translation of Gita Govinda; the Chitrapats that accompanied Sankardeva's one-act play in the satryia tradition, and the distinctive tradition of murals adorning the satras.</p>
				<p>Rich with cane and bamboo forests, Assam has not only the raw material but also the tine artistic sense of making the cane furniture which are highly appreciated all over the world.</p>
				<p>Brass and Bell metal products are famous or their beauty, strength and utility. In Hajo of Kamrup district Brass is an important cottage industry. Sarthebari in the same district is famous for Bell metal crafts.</p>
				<p>Assam's villages are filled with artisans who are talented as only they are. The terracotta industry of (Goalpara bears eloquent testimony to the sheer handiwork of these village sculptors and craftsmen. Beautiful, hand-crafted works of art designed to serve as small souvenirs and living-room display form their main thrust of activity.</p>
				<p>Also impressive is the craft work made from Kuhila - something that is totally unique to the villages of Assam.</p>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h3>Cuisine</h3>
				<p>Food in Assam is essentially rice-based and it is blessed with generous dosages of interestingly cooked fish and meat dishes that go on to comprise that delightful item on the Menu.</p>
				<p>Simplicity is the speciality of the Assamese cuisines and varieties of ingredients. Assamese dishes are less spicy than any other Indian dishes, but carry richness of taste and health. Versatility of the Assamese cuisine is very wide. There are dozens of Khar and Tenga preparation. Assamese cuisine is generally low on oil and spices baring a few special dishes, but exotic herbs often impart strong flavour. Assamese are by and large non-vegetarian.</p>

		<p>Assamese cuisine is the cuisine of Assam, a state in North-East India. It is a style of cooking that is a confluence of cooking habits of the hills that favor fermentation and drying as forms of food preservation, and those from the plains that provide fresh vegetables and abundance of fish from its many rivers and ponds; both of which are centered around the main ingredient—rice. It is a mixture of different indigenous styles with considerable regional variations and some external influences. The cuisine is characterized by very little use of spices, little cooking over fire and strong flavors due mainly to the use of endemic exotic fruits and vegetables that are either fresh, dried or fermented. Fish is widely used, and birds like duck, squab etc. are very popular, which are often paired with a main vegetable or ingredient. Preparations are rarely elaborate—the practice of Bhuna, the gentle frying of spices before the addition of the main ingredients so common in Indian cooking, is absent in the cuisine of Assam.</p>
		<p>A traditional meal in Assam begins with a khar, a class of dishes named after the main ingredient, and ends with a tenga, a sour dish. These two dishes characterize a traditional meal in Assam. The food is usually served in bell metal utensils made by an indigenous community called Mariya. Tamul (betel nut, generally raw) and paan generally concludes the meal.</p>
		<p>Though still obscure, this cuisine has seen wider notice in recent times. The discovery of this cuisine in the popular media continues, with the presenters yet to settle on the language and the specific distinctiveness to describe it.</p>

				<h3>Ingredients</h3>
				<ul data-role="listview">
					<li>
						<h2>Rice</h2>
						<p>Rice is the most important ingredient in this cuisine. The large varieties of rice found in the region has led to speculation that the grain was first domesticated in the Assam- Yunnan region. Both the indica as well as the japonica varieties are grown in Assam. The most popular class of rice is the joha or scented rice. As a staple diet rice is eaten either steam boiled (ukhua) or sundried (aaroi). Some very fine quality of rice namely, Karaballam or kauribadam etc. are available in Assam only. Rice is eaten as snack in many different forms: roasted and ground (xandoh), boiled in its husk and flattened (chira), puffed (akhoi). There also grows a variety of rice that can be just soaked and eaten (kumol saul).</p>
						<p>Rice is a part of all meals in Assam. A traditional breakfast consists of chira with yogurt and jaggery. Farmers eat cooked rice soaked overnight (poita) garnished with mustard oil, onions, etc. Snacks would be xandoh, kumol saul or bora saul, a sticky variety with milk. For other major meals, rice could be boiled, steamed or wrapped in leaves and roasted.</p>
						<p>A special class of rice preparations, called pithas are generally made only on special occasions like the Bihu. Made usually with soaked and ground glutinous rice (bora saul), they could be fried in oil with a sesame filling (xutuli pitha), roasted in young green bamboo over a slow fire (sunga pitha) or baked and rolled over a hot plate with a filling (kholasapori pitha).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Fish</h2>
						<p>The next most important ingredient is the fish, harvested from the many rivers, ponds and lakes in the region. There is no traditional ethnic community in Assam that does not eat fish. Most traditional rural households have their own ponds for pisciculture. Some of the most popular big fishes are the rou, ilish and cital (big), khoria (medium) (Chitala chitala), maagur, Xingi, borali, bhokua, Xaal, Xol, etc. The small varieties of fish available and eaten in Assam like puthi, borolia, mua, ceniputhi, tengera, lachin, bhagun, pabho, etc.[5][6] The discerning gourmet would be able to tell which region of Assam is known for which variety of fish.</p>
						<p>The most popular dish from Assam, the tenga (fish sour), is an indispensable part of a proper meal in Assam. The most popular tenga is made with tomatoes, though ones made with kajinemu (thick skinned elongated lemon) and thekera (dried Mangosteen,) are also popular. Another favorite is small fish roasted in banana leaves (paatotdia). Hukuti is a special fish dish prepared from dried small fish (puthi maas) pounded with arum stem and dried and stored in bamboo tubes. Variations of this exist among the ethnic communities of Northeast India in general and Assam in particular, are dried and fermented small fish puthy mas (Ticto barb), three to four in numbers are roasted along with lavish amounts of green chillies, tomatoes, ginger and garlic (all roasted). The ingredients are then pounded in a mortar to make a coarse paste and served with rice.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Meat</h2>
						<p>The Assamese meat and fish dish is characterized by low amount of spices and oil, higher quantity of ginger, norosingho paat (Curry leaves) and lemon juice. This is quite different from Bengali dishes in taste. Pork and to some extent, beef dishes are particularly favorites in the tribal areas in Assam. Beef is not taken by the majority of Assamese as they practice Hinduism; however, beef is popular among Assamese Muslims, although general people also have pork, but that is not taken by the Assamese Muslims. The basic cooking method is boiling. Onla, of the Bodos, is made with ground rice and special herbs, and constitutes a complete meal in itself. Other meats include squab, duck, chicken, mutton, venison, and turtle although venison and turtle meat are legally prohibited. The combination of duck – white gourd and squab – papaya or banana flower is very popular. Meat is curried in spicy gravy.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Greens & Vegetables</h2>
						<p>The environs of Assam are rich in vegetation, and green leafy vegetables, called xaak, are an important part of the cuisine. Some of them are grown while others like the dhekia (fern) grows wild. There is a bewildering variety that is eaten and according to custom, one has to have a hundred different xaaks (greens) during Rongali Bihu.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Spices</h2>
						<p>Among spices there are ginger, garlic, onion, cumin seed, black cumin, black pepper, chilli, turmeric, coriander seed, cinnamon, cardamom, clove, fenugreek seed, white mustard seed, aniseed, Malabar leaf, etc.</p>
